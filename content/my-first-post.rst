Dear everybody,

it is time to start.

It is time I try to put some order nto my ideas and make them available to others, and to me of tomorrow.
I do not pretend to make up a serious blog, to keep it updated or whatever. I'd like most of all to have a method to
share what I thought and realized with the rest of the web.
I also hope friends and lovers will be able to write her, overpassing the tricks of github.

So, to start, I will try to publish here the following topics:

    - Ideas in neuroscience I think are cool

    - Ideas and other think I rescue about identity and depersonalization

    - Events of my life with a broader relevance

    - Suggestions and trickes (someone's else blog too)

    - I will not publish tips&tricks of informatics

Also I will endeavor to make my amazing collection of non-sense image available to everybody.

Thanks myself for have spent this time on the fucking pelican system.
Thanks everybody for a occasional support,

your

Tomas Parzen
